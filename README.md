# Election_Analysis

**Module 3 Challenge:**

**Overview of Election Audit**
The purpose of this analysis was to recount the votes to see who won the election and to see the breakdown by county of where those votes came from. From this we were able to determine the percentages of votes coming from each county and the percentage each candidate received.

**Election-Audit Summary:**

**Statement:**

This script can be used for any election as it is very efficient, it runs through thousands of ballots in seconds, and can easily be edited so that it can be used for any election in any region. The code can also be modified to adhere to different types of elections. For example, instead of declaring the winner the candidate with the highest percentage, the script can be changed to hit a target number like what is required in the electoral college. Another modification that would make this very powerful would be to monitor more variables. In elections voters must register with all their personal information. With some minor changes this script would be able to show the vote counts by age, race, gender, etc.
